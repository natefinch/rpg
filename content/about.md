 I have been a professional developer since 1999 after graduating with a CS
 degree from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/).  I spent
 13 years developing in C++ and C# in various startups before picking up Go in
 2012.

I've been working as a Gopher at [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com) since the
summer of 2013, working on [jujuj](https://jujucharms.com), one of the largest
open source Go projects.

I started the Go Boston Google+ group which became the first major meetup for Go
programmers in Boston and eventually became the Boston Golang meetup group.  I
am an organizer of the Framingham, MA Go Meetup.  

I have written a ton of Go packages and commands, some of the most popular being
[Lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack),
[pie](https://github.com/natefinch/pie), and
[gorram](https://github.com/natefinch/gorram)

When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with my family in semi-rural
Massachusetts.  I love tabletop gaming and have been playing D&D since the 80's.
