There's basically two routes you can take when writing a tabletop RPG -
setting-first, or rules-first.  I would argue that you should almost always
write rules-first.  More than perhaps any other choice you can make, the
setting is the thing that can turn people off the fastest.

Take Blades in the Dark, for example.  It's an incredibly innovative rules
system that does a half dozen things that I had never seen in an RPG before —
structured downtime, effect vs. position codified in the rules, mechanical
flashbacks etc.  But at the same time, it is paired with an oddly unique setting
— an industrial city filled with ghosts and demons.  If you don't fancy your
gang of rogues fighting ghosts.... there's a lot you need to ignore in this
book.

A lot of RPG designers are also world builders, and they love diving into
timelines and factions and other minutae of their world.  Too often, they throw unique elements of their setting into the basic rules of their game, which makes the game inextricably intertwined with the setting.  Take Headspace, a cyberpunk 

 Often, it is the setting more than any other part of a new RPG that spells its doom.  Rarely, it is the setting that draws players into the system.
